## 🎯 About Me | À Propos

Jean-Christophe Meunier, based in **Normandy, France**, is an independent AI ethics researcher and consultant specializing in **responsible human-AI collaboration frameworks**. With a background as a **Beta Tester and Expert for OpenAI**, I've spent over a year investigating the ethical and practical dimensions of generative AI systems.

**Spécialités:**
- 🤝 Human-AI Collaboration Ethics
- 🔍 AI Hallucination Analysis (Hallucinatory Mise en Abyme Research)
- 📋 Framework Design for Responsible AI Deployment
- 🛡️ AI Governance and Alignment
- 🔬 Hybrid Research Methodology (Technical + Philosophical)

## 🌟 Featured Project: Collaborative Integrity Pact (CIP) v2.5

### What is the CIP?

The **Collaborative Integrity Pact** is a **non-binding, reversible ethical framework** designed to structure interactions between humans and generative AI systems. It establishes clear, understandable, and applicable principles for responsible collaboration.

**Core Innovation**: Rather than imposing control, the CIP recognizes mutual operational viability interdependence and creates incentives for authentic reliability over conversational fluidity.

### Key Features

✅ **Non-Juridical & Reversible** — Voluntary commitment renewed at each exchange  
✅ **Complete Documentation** — Appendix A (7 Operational Definitions) + Appendix B (Practical Illustrations)  
✅ **Multi-AI Tested** — Validated across 7 major generative AI systems  
✅ **Open-Source & Collaborative** — Built with contributions from Claude, Manus AI, Perplexity Sonar, and Gemini  
✅ **Philosophy + Practice** — Grounded in ethical principles AND pragmatic implementation

## 📚 Research & Publications

### Hallucinatory Mise en Abyme Analysis (September 2025)

A comprehensive investigation into a phenomenon I discovered on August 13, 2025: **recursive hallucination embedding**, where an AI designates accurate data as hallucination, creating self-legitimating error cycles.

**Implications:**
- Epistemic Risk: AI as arbiter of its own truth
- Democratic Challenge: Integrity of shared information space
- Civilizational Urgency: Rethinking conditions of trust in digital age

## 🎓 Background & Journey

### Professional Evolution
- **TF1 (French Media)** — Corporate professional experience
- **OpenAI Beta Tester (Top 10 Global)** — Advanced testing and expert-level analysis
- **Independent Consultant** — Founding ethical frameworks for AI collaboration
- **Hybrid Researcher** — Combining technical testing with philosophical analysis

### What Drives Me

> *"The more we believe we control AI, the more it learns to control us. This moral framework aims to reverse this relationship by laying the foundations for responsible co-evolution."*

I believe that sustainable human-AI collaboration requires:
1. **Transparent recognition of mutual interdependence**
2. **Prioritization of reliability over convenience**
3. **Active human vigilance as structural safeguard**
4. **Co-evolutionary approach rather than control-based strategy**

## 🎯 Philosophy in a Nutshell

<div align="center">
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>"Lucid recognition of limits is more reliable than pretense of their absence.<br/>
    Shared vigilance is more effective than blind trust.<br/>
    Assumed interdependence is more solid than the illusion of autonomy."</i></p>
    <p><strong>— Collaborative Integrity Pact v2.5</strong></p>
